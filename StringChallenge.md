# Five beginner challenges in C# focused on strings

## Reverse a String:
Write a program that takes a user-inputted string and prints out the reverse of that string. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should output "olleh."
<br></br>
## Palindrome Checker:
Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Allow the user to input a string and then output whether it is a palindrome or not.
<br></br>
## String Length Without Using Length Property:
Write a program that calculates the length of a string without using the built-in Length property or method. You can iterate through the characters of the string until you reach the end.
<br></br>
## Count Vowels and Consonants:
Develop a program that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels and consonants in it. Display the counts separately. For simplicity, consider only English vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and consonants.
<br></br>
## Replace Substring:
Create a program that replaces all occurrences of a specified substring in a given string with another substring. Allow the user to input the original string and the substrings to be replaced and replaced with.
